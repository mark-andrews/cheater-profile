How to use logistic regression to calculate class conditional probabilities. 
The aim of this to show the general principle, but the worked example is a quick and dirty and there should be much more thoroughness in a real analysis.
For example, in a real analysis, I would not assume uniform distributions over the predictor variables, nor would I necessarily use stepwise regression to find a minimal set of predictors, and I would look at joint probability distributions using multivariate visualization rather than marginal probability distributions and averages.
